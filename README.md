This is an interactive network graph visualized with D3

Doubleclick on a node to switch to selection mode and fade out all nodes but the node you selected and all nodes that are somehow connected. By clicking on nodes now, you select those networks too. Right click switches off the selection mode and restores everything back to normal. This functionality is especially interesting for large network graphs.
